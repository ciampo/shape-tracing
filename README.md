# Shape tracing

Code experiment on 2d graphics.

## TODO

- shape dots: allow for random numbers in direction. The higher the current direction, the less probable for it go even higher. Then pick a sign for it.
- Allow for dots to start from the same vertex. Limit the number of "starting" vertices for each shape (w/ random).
- increase pace between shapes
- add some randomness to the radius (+/- 5% ?)
- pop dots quicker
- stagger dots scale up animations (randomly, maybe based on the order within the dots array)
- consider adding subtle drop shadow to the shapes. Shadows gets more transparent and further away as the shape is drawn.
- cleanup code
