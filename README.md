# Shape tracing

Code experiment on 2d graphics.

## TODO

- shape dots: allow for even more possible combinations?
- shape angle: allow for "flat" octagons
- stagger dots scale up animations (randomly, maybe based on the order within the dots array)
- consider adding subtle drop shadow to the shapes. Shadows gets more transparent and further away as the shape is drawn.
- cleanup code
