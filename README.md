# Shape tracing
Code experiment on 2d graphics.


## TODO:
- shape generation: start with one shape, keep adding another one as soon as the last shape has started to be drawn
- shape dots: allow for random numbers in direction. The higher the current direction, the less probable for it go even higher. Then pick a sign for it.
- allow for both light / dark mode (maybe pressing "c" switches color mode)
- cleanup code
